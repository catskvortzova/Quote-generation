# Quote-generation

I used a free access dataset to train the generating quote model.

https://github.com/ShivaliGoel/Quotes-500K

It contains 500 thousand quotes, some of which were used for training. Data was pre-prepared.

The trained architecture of the transformer showed better results than RNN, in particular LSTM.
Quotation generation is implemented in two ways: with fixing the temperature (the higher the temperature, the more diverse the results and the less adequate) and with the ability to reduce the temperature with the generation process by the end of the sentence.

## So, quotes from artificial intelligence:

### love is the most important thing that is the key to the world

### love is just the journey

### meaning of life is an unknown journey to invention

### be yourself and you will fall in love with no matter what you want

### be yourself and stay focus on what you want to be
